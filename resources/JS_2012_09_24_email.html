title: Newbie JavaScript Class 2 email
---
<p>Hi students,</p>
	<p>Sorry for the delayed message - long story short we had a rough time coming up with a homework assignment given where we left off in class Tuesday. 
	If you&#39;re itching to do something, I&#39;ve included a few exercises at the end of this email. 
	Since we were delayed in getting these to you these are optional, but you&#39;re encouraged to attempt them.</p>


	<h3>Feedback</h3>

	<p>Because the class was running slow we did not have a chance to cover this - we&#39;ve built online forms for you to provide feedback. 
	This is very important because it lets us know how we&#39;re doing and if we need to adjust our pace or how we&#39;re teaching. 
	There is one for Class #2 and one general feedback form - both are anonymous.</p>

	<p> Class 2 feedback:<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEpqZ09xNlRIdlNWMFkyOEtJN1M1aXc6MQ#gid=0" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEpqZ09xNlRIdlNWMFkyOEtJN1M1aXc6MQ#gid=0</a>
	
	<p>	General JS feedback:<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGxfUjhOWFVTdUhUM043MHNZNmZYanc6MQ#gid=0" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGxfUjhOWFVTdUhUM043MHNZNmZYanc6MQ#gid=0</a> </p>
	
	<h3>A bit of fun</h3>
	<p>Also didn&#39;t get to cover this in our class - for a fun example of what you can do with JavaScript - check out this comic at XKCD (be sure to click and drag the bottom frame)</p>
