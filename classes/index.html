  <p>Girl Develop It Columbus teaches classes, builds community, and provides resources for web and software development education for women and men in Columbus, Ohio. Our goal is to provide a low-pressure, friendly and fun learning environment and give students usable tools and expectations in order to achieve their own goals.</p>
    
  <p>We accomplish this by:</p>

  <ul id="mission">
    <li>providing introductory, multi-week courses in programming and HTML/CSS, as well as more advanced topics that are still designed to be welcoming and non-intimidating</li>
    <li>creating workshops for exploration of topics or audiences beyond our regular courses (for example, working with HTML5 and CSS3 specifically, or a kid/family-oriented workshop)</li>
    <li>hosting diverse speakers on various coding topics</li>
    <li>offering direction to the most appropriate external resources so that students can learn in the ways best suited to them</li>
    <li>establishing good communication between teachers and students</li>
    <li>focusing our teaching approach so that students feel comfortable asking questions, engaged in the material and empowered to learn difficult concepts</li>
    <li>highlighting women currently working in the development field as role models</li>
  </ul>
