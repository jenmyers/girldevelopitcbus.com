## Girl Develop It Columbus

Yea, verily, this doth be the repository for girldevelopitcbus.com. In the dawn of the year 2012, we did give birth to the enterprise that continues to this day.

Frontiers we have yet to conquer:

* mark up secondary page layout
  * create individual layouts for content sections?
* change heading levels
* turn logo into h1 with background image?
* insert content
* update current sponsor logos
* hook up dynamic page titles
* research pulling in Meetup calendar data
