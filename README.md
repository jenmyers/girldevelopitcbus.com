## Girl Develop It Columbus

Yea, verily, this doth be the repository for girldevelopitcbus.com. In the dawn of the year 2012, we did give birth to the enterprise that continues to this day.

Frontiers we have yet to conquer:

* complete content
  * current teachers
  * mentor guidelines
* add media queries for responsive layout
* clean up contact form markup


### How to update the site

* Prerequisite - You will need to have ruby installed with the jekyll gem
* Make your changes to the files as needed
* Run the command jekyll at the root of the project.  This will generate files in the _site folder
* commit the base project files you edited as well as the corresponding _site folder files.
