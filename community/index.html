  <p>In addition to classes, we host a variety of meetups, programs, workshops and speakers to talk with and learn from other coders, beginners and experts alike. If you are a possible future student or a professional from the community who wants to help out, you have an open invitation to stop by any event and get to know us better. See our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/girldevelopitcbus/events/calendar/">full calendar</a> for upcoming events.</p>

  <h3>Teachers &amp; Teaching Assistants</h3>

  <p>We're almost always looking for more good teachers and TAs. We expect our teachers to no only be able to rock the subject matter but be particularly good at presenting it to beginners. If you want to participate in an existing class or have an idea for a future one, read over our <a href="teacher-guidelines.html">teacher guidelines</a> and hop on our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/girl-develop-it-columbus-teachers">teacher mailing list</a> to let us know. We also want to hear from people interested in leading one-day workshops on more advanced topics.</p>
  
  <p>You can also get to know some of our <a href="teachers.html">current teachers</a>.</p>

  <h3>Speakers &amp; Workshops</h3>
  
  <p>We host regular hack nights where coders from the community can get together, work on projects and help each other learn. Often, we have speakers who stop by to present on various topics related to the field. We're also developing a series of workshops to offer instruction on a broader range of languages and applications.</p>

  <h3>Mentorship program</h3>

  <p>Our mentor program matches GDIC students with experts for one-on-one education beyond the classroom. We currently working on building a base of available mentors, so if you're interested in becoming one, <a href="mentors.html">check out our mentor guidelines</a>.</p>
