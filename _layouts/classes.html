        <h2>Classes</h2>

        <p><strong>Girl Develop It Columbus is creating something new.</strong> We teach classes, build community, and provide resources on web and software development education for women and men in Columbus, Ohio. We offer regular introductory classes on programming principles and HTML/CSS, and are currently rotating in more advanced topics like Javascript and Ruby on Rails.</p>
          
        <p>Our goal is to provide a low-pressure, friendly and fun learning environment and give students usable tools and expectations in order to achieve their own goals. We care about communication, feedback and connecting individually with students who have questions, ideas and anything in between to discuss.</p>

        <p>We keep the list of upcoming classes, class registration and other class details at our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/girldevelopitcbus/">Meetup group</a>. If a particular class is full, you can join its waitlist in the case that a spot opens up. You can also join our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/girl-develop-it-columbus">mailing list</a> to receive first notice of new classes.</p>
